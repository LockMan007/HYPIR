This image showcases the Florence Cathedral, also known as Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, dominating the skyline of Florence, Italy. Its iconic terracotta dome and ornate white, green, and pink marble facade are prominently featured, with Giotto's Campanile (bell tower) standing tall to its left. The city's characteristic red-tiled roofs spread out below, and distant mountains frame the background under a partly cloudy sky.
