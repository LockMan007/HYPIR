This image shows Minato Namikaze, a character from the Naruto series, from behind. He is wearing his signature white Hokage cloak, which features the kanji for "Fourth Hokage" (四代目火影) vertically down the back. His spiky blonde hair is visible above the collar, and he appears to be in motion, with dark, leaf-like or shuriken shapes falling around him against a dramatic, cloudy, orange-hued sky.
