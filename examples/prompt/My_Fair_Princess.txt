The image displays two East Asian women in elaborate, traditional costumes, likely from a historical drama or opera. The woman on the left, with an open mouth and wide eyes, wears a vibrant pink and purple embroidered top and a large pink floral headpiece. The woman on the right, partially visible, has a similarly ornate headpiece with pink flowers and a colorful striped garment. Both are adorned with intricate makeup.
